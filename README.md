# os161
A BSD-like mini-operating system originally designed at Harvard. Runs on a simulator called sys161. I implemented locks, condition variables, thread forking, several system calls (exit, waitpid, getpid), and I am currently implementing virtual memory. Ongoing project for no reason other than to learn. :-)
